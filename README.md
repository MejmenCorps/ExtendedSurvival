# ExtendedSurvival

We can finally start project ;D

To do:
-new craft recipes
-custom drop (like sticks drop from leaves and so on)
-custom stats like body heat and thirst for water... maybe in table on the right edge of the screen or something
-some things to do lol
-health lost by destroying blocks with your hand
-maybe structures like campfire or tent to "repair" stats

we can do it if you want <3
